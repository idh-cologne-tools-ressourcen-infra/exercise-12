# Exercise 12

This exercise is about LaTeX.

You have two options for doing this exercise:

1. Install LaTeX on your own computer. It's free, it's well documented, and it is supported on all relevant operating systems (including, to some extent, smartphones and tables). For installation, check out these links: [Windows](https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html),  [Unix/Linux](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html),  [Mac](https://www.tug.org/mactex/). If you have installed it, you'll need a plain text editor and a command line, or an IDE.
2. Create an account on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and do the exercise there.

## Step 1

Please clone this repository onto your local computer. On the command line, you would enter: `git clone https://github.com/idh-cologne-tools-ressourcen-infra/exercise-12`, and create a new branch using your UzK username as a name.

## Step 2

Create a document with the `scrartcl` class. Create a document that contains 

- multiple sections and a table of contents
- at least one equation
- at least one table

The content doesn't really matter -- either take textual material from Wikipedia, or a news article.

## Step 3
Download or copy the tex file into this repository, add it to git and push it to the server, as usual.
